# SNN vs. CNN: A Performance Comparison on Image Recognition Tasks

This repository contains code for comparing the performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on image recognition tasks. Both SNNs and CNNs are popular architectures in the field of deep learning, but they operate on different principles. While CNNs are based on traditional neural network architectures and are widely used for image classification tasks, SNNs are inspired by the biological neurons' spiking behavior and promise more energy-efficient computing.

## Contents
